#+title: Y86-64 Emulator 
#+author: Nicholas Hubbard

An emulator for the Y86-64 ISA defined in =Computer Systems - A Programmers
Perspective= by Bryant and O'Hallaron.

This project is currently a work in progress.

I can't imagine how this could be useful to anyone but I want to learn more
about assemblers, linkers, CPUs, emulators, and Common Lisp.
