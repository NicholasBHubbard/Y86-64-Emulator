#+title: Y8664 Emulator 
#+author: Nicholas Hubbard

An emulator for the Y86-64 ISA defined in chapter 4 of the third edition of
=Computer Systems - A Programmers Perspective= by Bryant and O'Hallaron.

This project is currently a work in progress.

I can't imagine how this could be useful to anyone (a sign of a great project),
but I want to learn more about assemblers, linkers, CPUs, emulators, and Common
Lisp.
